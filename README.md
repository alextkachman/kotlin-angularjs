Try to use Kotlin to write the angularjs TODO MVC demo.

You can see there are several .kt files in the "src" directory, which are kotlin files and will be compiled to Javascript code.

Finally, it works ~

To run this project, you should use IDEA + Kotlin plugin, and configure it carefully to make it compiling.
After compiling, there will be a "kotlin-angularjs.js" file under "out/production/kotlin-angularjs/".

You can use browser to open the "index.html" file to view the demo. If you use chrome,
please make sure it can visit local js files.

Although there are some issue to use Kotlin to work with Angularjs, but it works and I'm feeling good.
I think it will be better and better in the near future.

I'm new to Kotlin, the code is not very good. Please help me to improve it, thank you ~
